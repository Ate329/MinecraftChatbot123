# MinecraftChatbot123
A minecraft chat bot that can send and receive messages in the server chat without yourself entering the game.   
        
(Contains a user friendly GUI made by Tk)       
        
The main idea is to create a fake player in the server so it can send messages and get the messages from the server chat.

# Functions
Anti-afk by entering ;startafk to start and ;stopafk to stop        
        
Auto-reconnect      
        
Auto-respawn        
        
Sending the messages you want and receiving messages from players (including yourself)

# Libraries
Mineflayer      
        
Javascript      
        
tkinter     
        
time        

# Current issues
The username can only be ChatBot for some reasons, if it is changed to other names, it does not show the messages that the bot sent, very weird.       
        
After auto reconnecting, the programme will not work anymore, it can neither receive nor send messages (But the GUI will remains). I had been working on this issues for sevral hours, but it still doesn't work. For instance change the reconnect function to retsarting the whole programme and put the bot in a def function, however, none of them work.
        
I'm not pretty sure whether it's the problem of the server or the programme. (Hopefully someone will find out and fix the problems one day, I do not have the skills to fix them tbh)
